######################

### Default Flags ###   DO NOT MODIFY
# DO NOT MODIFY THESE IN THIS FILE : Instead, run with `make LOCAL=0 DEBUG=1` for example.

# You will be graded with the default values

## Set to 0 if you want to compile for telerun. This is how we will grade you.
## Set to 1 if you want to compile for your native machine
LOCAL := 0

## Set to 1 if you want to statically link your binary. Otherwise, set to 0.

# Set to 1 if you want to compile in debug mode

# Set to 1 if you want to compile with the undefined behavior sanitizer

### Compiler Settings ###

# DO NOT MODIFY THE COMPILER
# You will be graded with the clang compiler that ships with the course VM

# You can modify these flags if you know what to do.
